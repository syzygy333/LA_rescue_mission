I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. We have a saboteur aboard. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canap√©s? Are you up for promotion? Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise."
